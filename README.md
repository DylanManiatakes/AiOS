# AiOS

AiOS is an operating system that aims to provide a seamless voice-controlled user experience powered by large language models (LLMs). 

## Overview

The goal of AiOS is to create an operating system that requires minimal input from the user besides voice interactions. Core OS functions like app launching, file management, and settings configuration will be handled through natural language conversations with an integrated LLM assistant.

Key features:

- Voice-based user interface for core OS functions
- Integration with large language models to enable natural conversation abilities 
- Ability to launch apps, open files, adjust settings purely through voice commands
- Contextual awareness to understand user intent and maintain conversation flow
- Customizable wake word and voice to activate the AI assistant
- Secure handling of sensitive OS functions and user data

By leveraging recent advances in language model capabilities, AiOS hopes to pioneer a new paradigm in operating system UX centered around conversational AI. The goal is to reduce the need for traditional GUI navigation and typing in favor of more intuitive voice-based interactions.
